## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript

### What I learned

- It's still difficult anyway to build a good form.
- Tested with Chrome Screen Reader, somehow `aria-errmessage` doesn't work, it has to be `aria-describedby`.
